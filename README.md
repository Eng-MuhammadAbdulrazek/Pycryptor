#PyCryptor
The "PyCryptor" script is a simple Python program that provides a user-friendly menu interface for performing various encryption and hashing operations. Users can choose from a selection of encryption methods, including Caesar Cipher, Base64 encoding/decoding, Fernet encryption/decryption, and hash functions such as MD5, SHA-256, and SHA-512.

Features:

Caesar Cipher: Encrypt or decrypt text using the classic Caesar Cipher with a user-defined shift value.
Base64 Encoding/Decoding: Encode or decode text using the Base64 algorithm, a common method for encoding binary data.
Fernet Encryption/Decryption: Encrypt or decrypt text using Fernet symmetric key cryptography from the cryptography library.
Hash Functions: Compute the hash value of input text using MD5, SHA-256, or SHA-512 algorithms.
User-Friendly Menu: Intuitive menu interface for easy selection of desired encryption or hashing operations.
Modular Code: The script is organized into modular files for each encryption method, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
Exit Option: Users can gracefully exit the program when finished with their operations.
Usage:

Run the script.
Choose an encryption method from the menu.
Follow on-screen prompts to input necessary data (text, shift values, keys, etc.).
View the results of the chosen encryption or hashing operation.
Repeat or exit the program as needed.
Note: For security-critical applications, consider using established cryptographic libraries and algorithms.
